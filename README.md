# ML to predict the value of BTC
>[!NOTE]
>The metrics are bad but I public the code because the result of prediction was close to the reality.

This project is only to learn, it's one of my first projects of ML, if someone wants to help me to improve my code or give me any tip is accepted and i aprecciate it, the results are close to the reality but the metrics results are so bad and i dont know why.

### Motivation
This is a personal project, im trying to improve my software skills because i enjoy programming and im trying to learn finances, this is why of the project.

### Project Overview
This app was built using the [Geeks for Geeks article on Bitcoin Price Prediction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitcoin-price-prediction-using-machine-learning-in-python/) as a reference.
